# Solution ACME exercise
##  Overview of the solution

First of all, I had to analyze what was the output desired, and how to made this with an optimal solution. After of analyzed some paths to the solution, the best decision decided to follow OOP paradigm, and MVC architecture to separate the business logic (the controllers) of the models. Last, but not least important, the solution was made following the SOLID principles, that allowed me to write more clean code.  


## Explanation of the architecture

After of an analisis of the expected solution, I decided that this has to follow the OOP paradigm because, this allow that the code can be reutilized, organized and easy to mantain. Even, this paradigm follows the principle DRY, that avoid the code duplication and make eficents programs. 
Also, I tried that the solution can get a more simplified way of be understood by others, so I separate the classes and packages into models and controller, following the MVC architecture was the better option. With this, the program logic was separated of the models, reducing the coupling.
